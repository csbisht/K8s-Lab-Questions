Q1) Create deployment called web-001 on cluster1 and deployment called web-002 on cluster2 and deployment called web-003 on cluster3, with image nginx:1.17 and replica=1. Next upgrade the deployment to version 1.18 using rolling update and then scale it to replica=3. Make sure the version upgrade is recorded in the resource annotation and also make sure desired number of pod always running.
