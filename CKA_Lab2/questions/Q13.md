Q13) Create a pod called web-front using image nginx on each clusters (cluster1..3) and expose it internally with a service called web-front-svc. Check that you are able to lookup service and pod from within the cluster.

Use image: busybox:1.28 for dns lookup and record results on jump as below files at location /opt/K8sLab/Lab2:

cluster1:- web-front-cluster1.pod and web-front-cluster1.svc 

cluster2:- web-front-cluster2.pod and web-front-cluster2.svc 

cluster3:- web-front-cluster3.pod and web-front-cluster3.svc
