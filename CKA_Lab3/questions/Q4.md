Q4) Create deployment called nginx-web1 on cluster1 and deployment called nginx-web2 on cluster2 
    and deployment called nginx-web3 on cluster3, with image nginx:1.18 and replica=1. Next upgrade 
    the deployment to version 1.19 using rolling update and then scale it to replica=3. Version upgrade 
    should be recorded in the resource annotation and desired number of pod should be running.
