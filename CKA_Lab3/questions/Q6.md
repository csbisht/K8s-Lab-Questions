Q6) Take a backup of ETCD database of each clusters (cluster1..3) and save it to /opt/etcd_backup_good.db on 
    controlplane node of each cluster.
    Create a pod etcdtest-pod with image nginx on each clusters (cluster1..3) and now assume your etcd 
    database has some issues. So, now you have to restore it with your previous good backup on each 
    clusters (cluster1..3) before restore you have to take again backup as /opt/etcd_backup_bad.db.
