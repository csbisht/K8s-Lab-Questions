Q6) Take a backup of ETCD database of each clusters (cluster1..3) and save it to /opt/etcd_backup_good.db on controlplane node of each cluster.

After the etcd backup create a pod etcdtest-pod with image nginx on each clusters (cluster1..3) and now assume your etcd database has some issues. So, now you have to restore it with your previous good backup on each clusters (cluster1..3) before restore you have to take again backup as /opt/etcd_backup_bad.db.

Note:- There are two steps to restore ETCD.
    
First step - change the data-dir from manifests of etcd.yaml
    
Second step - mentioned below:
    
##Restore etcd in a directory

member_id=`sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt member list |cut -d',' -f1`

peer_urls=`sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml |grep -w initial-advertise-peer-urls |cut -d'=' -f2`

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /opt/etcd_backup_good.db --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-backup --initial-advertise-peer-urls="${peer_urls}" --initial-cluster="${member_id}=${peer_urls}" --name="${member_id}" --skip-hash-check=true
   
##Stop kubelet and docker service to avoid data corruption

sudo systemctl stop kubelet

sudo systemctl stop docker
    
##ETCD data-dir is /var/lib/etcd, so run below command to restore it.

sudo mv /var/lib/etcd /var/lib/etcd_bkp_bad

sudo mv /var/lib/etcd-backup /var/lib/etcd

sudo systemctl start docker

sudo systemctl start kubelet
