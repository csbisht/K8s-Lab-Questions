Q19) Convert the ClusterIP to NodePort=30008 for the same service of deployment 
     web-nginx1, web-nginx2, web-nginx3 respectively on clusters(1..3) and find the NodePort.
     Check that you are able to connect with your services using NodePort from within the cluster.
     Create a temp busybox pod and execute the following command to test it:
	    
     # wget -O- $PUBLIC_NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT	
		
     Store the output on jump as below files at location /opt/K8sLab/Lab3:
     cluster1:- NodePort-cluster1.wget
     cluster2:- NodePort-cluster2.wget 
     cluster3:- NodePort-cluster3.wget
