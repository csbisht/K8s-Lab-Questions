Q10) A new pod redispod is deployed on each clusters (cluster1..3). 
     There is something wrong with it. Identify the issue and fix it.
     Retrieve the events associated with this pod (listed in any order) and write them to a file as below.
     cluster1:- /opt/K8sLab/Lab3/events_redispod-cluster1.txt
     cluster2:- /opt/K8sLab/Lab3/events_redispod-cluster2.txt
     cluster3:- /opt/K8sLab/Lab3/events_redispod-cluster3.txt
     Note: Configuration changes are allowed if required, except pod name.
